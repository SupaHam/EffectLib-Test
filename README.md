# Introduction
Convenient plugin that allows you to test EffectLib's default effects implementations (and the ability to add your custom ones), this plugin's strongest feature is the serialization, which at this point in time only deserializes stuff in the format of (key=value,key2=value2...). All default implmentations have default the effect name lowercased, but that doesn't matter since the command argument is lowercased for convenience on my end.

Good luck, have fun!
